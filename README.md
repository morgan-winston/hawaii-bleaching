hawaii-coral-bleaching-2019 repository README

This repository contains code used to analyze the 2019 coral bleaching data collected across the Hawaiian Archipelago. There are six scripts included in this repository:
1) "2019_bleaching_drivers_analysis.R" This script investigates environmental and anthropogenic drivers of the 2019 bleaching event.
2) "2019_bleaching_spatial_analysis.R" This script examines spatial variability of the 2019 bleaching response across the archieplago.
3) "2019_bleaching_spatial_mapping.R" This script creates maps using ggmap() that show cluster-level bleaching responses at each island surveyed.
4) "2019_beaching_taxa_analysis.R" This script looks at differences in the 2019 bleaching response between different coral taxa at the domain and island scale.
5) "2019_bleaching_temporal_time_series.R" This script extracts satellite sea surface temperature and degree heating week data, and plots over time at each island surveyed to create visualizaitons of long-term trends in temperature and heat stress.
6) "2019_bleaching_temporal_analysis.R" This script analyzes differences in the 2019 bleaching response to the bleaching response experienced during the last major bleaching event prior (2015 in the Main Hawaiian Islands; 2014 in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands). 

These scripts use data that has been archived and documented in InPort.
